# COVID19_vaccine_study

Extracted data from CDC government databases relating to COVID19 outcomes (deaths or cases) and vaccination status' (type of vaccine, vaccinated with outcome, or boosted with outcome) for five different age groups. Transformed into dataframes with cleaned data and aggregations to tell a story about the effectiveness of COVID19 vaccines and boosters. Created interactive visualizations using altair; one presenting the rate of COVID19 deaths by county and another filtered line graph superimposing three different vaccination statuses with respected outcomes.
